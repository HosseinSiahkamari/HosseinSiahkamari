I'm a seasoned software developer with a two-year background in JavaScript, CSS, SASS, and HTML. Fueled by my passion for web development, I've recently re-entered the field, focusing on mastering React, Redux, and responsive design inspired by Tailwind CSS.

While my professional background is in land surveying engineering, my continuous learning in web development has led me to new horizons. Currently honing my skills in React, Redux, and responsive design, I aim to make meaningful contributions to the web development world.
